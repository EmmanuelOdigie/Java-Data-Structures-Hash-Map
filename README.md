Java-Data-Structures-Hash-Map
Working on adding pairs together, works like an arraylist but can take two information
It's best when the information relates to each other
out out will be [String,Charchter,int] = ["String,Charchter,int"] in this case the ',' is representing 'or' as you can use String or Charchter or int
